# BB's Teriyaki (Mobile App)

In this project, I built an app for a local Seattle restaurant chain, BB's Teriyaki. ([Check them out here](https://bbsteriyaki.com/). It's delicious!!) The purpose of this app is to allow customers to order for pickup, and build rewards on their profiles. BB's currently uses Toast but the owner would like to move towards their own app as they expand further.

To build this app, I used a variety of tools. Primarily I used React Native, with Expo providing some of the functionality. I handled all data, plus user authentication, using Firebase.

## Order Screen

This screen allows you to select items. It limits you to the max number and will not let you advance without selecting the required items.
