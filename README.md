# BB's Teriyaki (mobile app) [Alt Text](https://github.com/macrawford/bbs-teriyaki-app/blob/main/bbsteriyaki/BB_S.png)

In this project, I built an app for a local Seattle restaurant chain. (Check them out [here](https://bbsteriyaki.com/). It's delicious!!) The purpose of this app is to allow customers to order for pickup, and build rewards on their profiles. BB's currently uses Toast but the owner would like to move towards their own app as they expand further.
