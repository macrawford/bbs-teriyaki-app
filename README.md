# BB's Teriyaki (Mobile App) <img src="https://github.com/macrawford/bbs-teriyaki-app/blob/main/bbsteriyaki/BB_S.png" width="10%" height="10%">

In this project, I built an app for a local Seattle restaurant chain, BB's Teriyaki. ([Check them out here](https://bbsteriyaki.com/). It's delicious!!) The purpose of this app is to allow customers to order for pickup, and build rewards on their profiles. BB's currently uses Toast but the owner would like to move towards their own app as they expand further.

To build this app, I used a variety of tools. Primarily I used React Native, with Expo providing some of the functionality. I handled all data, plus user authentication, using Firebase.
