# BB's Teriyaki (Mobile App)

In this project, I built an app for a local Seattle restaurant chain BB's Teriyaki ([Check them out here.](https://bbsteriyaki.com/) The food is delicious!!). The purpose of this app is to allow customers to order for pickup, and build rewards on their profiles. BB's currently uses Toast but the owner would like to move towards their own app as they expand further.

To build this app, I used a variety of tools. Primarily I used React Native, with Expo providing some of the functionality. I handled all data, plus user authentication, using Google Firebase.

## Getting Started

Due to the complex set-up, I recommend that those interested in exploring this app check out the screen-grab GIFs below and explore the codebase on GitHub. If you are interested in getting the app up and running, you will need to install Expo and create a Google Firebase database. The Firebase setup was particularly time-consuming, so I'll reserve that only for the brave!

### Instructions

In addition to installing Expo and setting up Google Firebase, you'll want to do the following:

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run 'npm install'.
3. Start the app with 'npm start'.

Starting with 'npm start' will take you to an Expo webpage where you can select 'Run on iOS simulator', 'Run on Android simulator' or choose from other options. You will need XTools installed to run on iOS simulator.

## Usage

For those who just want to see what this app is all about, I have included GIFs with relevant information.

### Order Screen

This screen allows you to select items. It limits you to the max number and will not let you advance without selecting the required items.
